# EVE Programming Language

> Note: This is the bootstrap implementation in Rust.

> [!WARNING]
> This language is in a pre-alpha state, and is currently not intended for any production usage.

Eve is a procedural programming language implemented in Rust as an educational exercise. As such, please do not use this language for anything other than personal usage. Only Linux x86-64 architecture is supported for now, with no immediate plans for future targets. 

### Design Goals
- Support systems programming with an easy and readable syntax
- Aiming for sensible abstractions over confusing abstractions

### Features

- [x] Compiled
- [x] Turing-Complete
- [x] C FFI
- [ ] Module system
- [ ] Pattern Matching
- [ ] Goal List (Soon)
